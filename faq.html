                  This is the first step to take, when you have decided to flee to Switzerland.
                  You need to apply for S-Status.
                  The status can be applied in one of the six FAC processing facilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For this process you have two possibilities:
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first approach is to use
                  <a href="https://www.sem.admin.ch/sem/en/home/asyl/ukraine/registerme.html#726635772" target="_blank">RegisterMe</a>
                  and fill out the form. You should retrieve an appointment in
                  such an FAC facility. Follow up this appointment and then follow the instructions of the person,
                  which is responsible for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The second possibility is to go directly to one of the six FACs and apply onsite for the S-Status. It is
                  not recommended to use this approach, as the queue time for the entrance is rather long. Hence, the
                  processing in FAC will be faster by using
                  <a href="https://www.sem.admin.ch/sem/en/home/asyl/ukraine/registerme.html#726635772" target="_blank">RegisterMe</a>.

                After arriving, there are two possibilities for accommodation in Switzerland. In case an
                accommodation has already been occupied, one can back to the accommodation and wait for the
                decision of the FAC if the S-Status is granted or not.
              </p>
              <p>
                In case that one does not have an accommodation, the FAC will help to get one. If this is not possible
                one will have the possibility to stay in the FAC itself. In both of those cases the person must wait for
                the confirmation of the FAC that the S-Status request had been processed and granted or rejected.

                After the previous process, you have to go to the district office to get a confirmation of residence. At
                this place (your place of residence) you can then apply for social assistance.
              </p>

              <p>
                Social assistance is a temporary monetary aid. You receive money from the state every month.
                However, this is only possible if you have financial problems. The district office will tell you
                everything you need to know about this and how to apply for this assistance.
              </p>

              <p>
                In addition, health insurance is compulsory in Switzerland. To obtain health insurance, it is also
                advisable to ask at the district office, as you can be helped quickly and easily at this location.
